# Diet Sentry 2.0
Windows Forms based diet monitoring application.
It contains an Australian based foods database with around 1800 foods, using the sensible units, kJ, g, mg and mL, and the d-MMM-yy HH:mm DateTime format. It also contains selected commercial foods based on their mandated Nutritional Information Panels.

When a food is consumed it is selected and an amount eaten entered. This appends the details to a DateTime stamped record. The cumulative totals of the daily Energy and nutrients can be monitored.

New foods can be manually added to the database. For convenience it is also possible to add a recipe to the foods database.
