# DietSentry
Windows Forms based diet monitoring application
It contains an Australian based foods database with around 1800 foods, using the sensible units, kJ, g, mg and mL, and the d-MMM-yy date format.
When a food is consumed it is selected and an amount eaten entered. This appends the details to a date stamped record. The cumulative totals of the daily Energy and nutrients can be monitored.
New foods can be manually added to the database. For convenience it is also possible to add a recipe to the foods database.
